# Identifying_phishing_websites
This is a machine learning project that utilizes a decision tree classifier to identify phishing websites. 
The dataset the model was trained on came from the UCI Machine Learning Repository titled "Phishing Websites".
I did not have time to compile a completely different set of testing data, so I was only able to provide a true test on 2 actual phishing websites. The model identified both of them correctly as phishing websites.
In conclusion, the model performed exceedingly well with over 91% in precision, acuracy, and recall. The parameters chosen were based off a data visualization performed using pie charts to see which parameters had significant differences.
